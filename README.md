# Software Engineering - Group B1 (2024)
Created by Matthew Ayete Corrales, Daniel González Braza, Albert Digon Quintillà, Wenwen Yang, Raquel Nuñez Padial, Guillem Vera Pérez.

Welcome to the repository of FilmHub, application for the **Software Engineering** course, Group B1, for the academic year 2024. This repository contains all files and documentation related to the development of projects and activities for this course.

## Description

In this repository, we will manage and develop the assignments for the **Software Engineering** course, focusing on the planning, design, implementation, and testing of software. Throughout the course, we will use agile development tools and methodologies to manage project progress.

## Tools Used

Several tools will be utilized to help us organize and develop the projects efficiently:

- **Trello**: We will use Trello for project and task management, implementing Kanban boards to plan activities.
- **GitHub**: This repository will serve as version control and for collaborative development of the projects. Each student is required to submit pull requests and perform code reviews.
- **Programming Languages**: Depending on the project, various programming languages will be used (e.g., Python, Java, etc.). You could find more details in the folder src/backend or src/frontend.

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

```
/docs
    - Project documentation, including requirements analysis, designs, and user manuals.
    
/src
    - Project source code. You can find also the description about the execution steps in each folder, backend and frontend.
    
/tests
    - Unit and functional tests.
    
/backlog
    - Archive of tasks and features that have not been implemented yet.
    
/meeting-notes
    - Summaries and minutes of team meetings.
```

## Contributions

Each group member is expected to contribute actively to the project, both in code development and in the planning and execution of tasks. The following guidelines are recommended:

1. **Fork the repository**: Each student should fork the repository and work in their own branch.
2. **Pull Requests**: After completing a task, create a pull request for the team to review and approve the changes.
3. **Task Assignment**: Tasks will be assigned via Trello or GitHub Issues. Each student must track progress and update the status of tasks as they advance.

## Methodology

We will use **agile methodologies**, such as Scrum or Kanban, to organize the team's work. This includes:

- **Sprints**: Each sprint will last 1 or 2 weeks. During the sprint, assigned tasks will be worked on, and progress will be reviewed.
- **Daily meetings**: Short meetings to track task progress and address any blockers.
- **Sprint reviews**: At the end of each sprint, a review of the completed work will be done, and the objectives for the next sprint will be adjusted.


## How to use
