# Software Engineering - Group B1 (2024)
Created by Matthew Ayete Corrales, Daniel González Braza, Albert Digon Quintillà, Wenwen Yang, Raquel Nuñez Padial, Guillem Vera Pérez
Welcome to the repository for the **Software Engineering** course, Group B1, for the academic year 2024. This repository contains all files and documentation related to the development of projects and activities for this course.

## Description

In this repository, we will manage and develop the assignments for the **Software Engineering** course, focusing on the planning, design, implementation, and testing of software. Throughout the course, we will use agile development tools and methodologies to manage project progress.

## Tools Used

Several tools will be utilized to help us organize and develop the projects efficiently:

- **Trello**: We will use Trello for project and task management, implementing Kanban boards to plan activities.
- **GitHub**: This repository will serve as version control and for collaborative development of the projects. Each student is required to submit pull requests and perform code reviews.
- **Programming Languages**: Depending on the project, various programming languages will be used (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).

## Repository Structure

The repository will be organized as follows:

```
/docs
    - Project documentation, including requirements analysis, designs, and user manuals.
    
/src
    - Project source code.
    
/tests
    - Unit and functional tests.
    
/backlog
    - Archive of tasks and features that have not been implemented yet.
    
/meeting-notes
    - Summaries and minutes of team meetings.
```

## Contributions

Each group member is expected to contribute actively to the project, both in code development and in the planning and execution of tasks. The following guidelines are recommended:

1. **Fork the repository**: Each student should fork the repository and work in their own branch.
2. **Pull Requests**: After completing a task, create a pull request for the team to review and approve the changes.
3. **Task Assignment**: Tasks will be assigned via Trello or GitHub Issues. Each student must track progress and update the status of tasks as they advance.

## Methodology

We will use **agile methodologies**, such as Scrum or Kanban, to organize the team's work. This includes:

- **Sprints**: Each sprint will last 1 or 2 weeks. During the sprint, assigned tasks will be worked on, and progress will be reviewed.
- **Daily meetings**: Short meetings to track task progress and address any blockers.
- **Sprint reviews**: At the end of each sprint, a review of the completed work will be done, and the objectives for the next sprint will be adjusted.
